# CSCI_127
All of the coding labs I worked on while taking CSCI 127 at Hunter during the Spring 2021 semester (the assignments are the files that start with 'p' or 'pg')

Majority of these coding labs are using Python along with a select few of its libraries. As I progressed on these labs, we eventually touched upon the basics of MIPS, Unix, and C++ towards the very end of the semester. Within this repository, there are either images, maps, or csv files that I have used to make these coding assignments work and function properly (via lab instructions)
