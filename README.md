# CSCI_127
All of the coding labs I worked on while taking CSCI 127 at Hunter during the Spring 2021 semester (the assignments are the files that start with 'p' or 'pg')

Majority of these coding labs are using Python along with a select few of its libraries. As I progressed on these labs, we eventually touched upon the basics of MIPS, Unix, and C++ towards the very end of the semester. Within this repository, there are either images, maps, or csv files that I have used to make these coding assignments work and function properly, or have created myself using these lab assignments (via lab instructions)
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Coding Assignment overview: 

  (pg1-6): Getting familiar with the ***print function, turtle library, for loops, variables,*** and ***strings*** inorder to perform simple tasks that either display text on the screen, or draw simple shapes on screen 
  (pg7-9): Getting familiar with simple ***string commands**** that change the strings into all uppercase, lowercase, or even converting each character into their corresponding ASCII code equivalence.
  (pg10): Using for loops to add certain types of paterns to out shapes.
  (pg11-12): Getting familiar with ***colors*** in the coding world, like referring them by ***name, hexadecimal, or in RGB (255 code)***. Assignments 11 and 12 show how we can see the different shades of blue (with some adjustments we can make this work for other colors too). 
  (pg13): Knowing how to adjust the color of any imported image and turn on/off color channels.
  (pg14-15): Getting familiar with ***lists***, and how to print them out using for loops.
  (pg16): Getting familiar with the ***input()*** function, which will allow the user to determine how many degrees our turtle will turn to the left by. Once that is done, it'll be displayed on screen
  (pg17): Replacing words from already established strings using the python *replace()* function.
  (pg18): This program will display a grid that has a size thats determined by the user, in which will show red/white stripes.
  (pg19): Using input(), the '/' and '%' operator, we will prompt the user to input any number of hours, which will return the amount of days/hours it's equivalent too.
  (pg20):
