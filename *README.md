# CSCI_127
All of the coding labs I worked on while taking CSCI 127 at Hunter during the Spring 2021 semester (the assignments are the files that start with 'p' or 'pg')

Majority of these coding labs are using Python along with a select few of its libraries. As I progressed on these labs, we eventually touched upon the basics of MIPS, Unix, and C++ towards the very end of the semester. Within this repository, there are either images, maps, or csv files that I have used to make these coding assignments work and function properly, or have created myself using these lab assignments (via lab instructions)

Coding Assignment overview: 

**Learning the basics of Python**

  (pg1-6): Getting familiar with the ***print function, turtle library, for loops, variables,*** and ***strings*** inorder to perform simple tasks that either display text on the screen, or draw simple shapes on screen.
  
  (pg7-9): Getting familiar with simple ***string commands**** that change the strings into all uppercase, lowercase, or even converting each character into their corresponding ASCII code equivalence.
  
  (pg10): Using for loops to add certain types of paterns to out shapes.
  
  (pg11-12): Getting familiar with ***colors*** in the coding world, like referring them by ***name, hexadecimal, or in RGB (255 code)***. Assignments 11 and 12 show how we can see the different shades of blue (with some adjustments we can make this work for other colors too). 
  
  (pg13): Knowing how to adjust the color of any imported image and turn on/off color channels.
  
  (pg14-15): Getting familiar with ***lists***, and how to print them out using for loops.
  
  (pg16): Getting familiar with the ***input()*** function, which will allow the user to determine how many degrees our turtle will turn to the left by. Once that is done, it'll be displayed on screen.
  
  (pg17): Replacing words from already established strings using the python *replace()* function.
  
  (pg18): This program will display a grid that has a size thats determined by the user, in which will show red/white stripes.
  
  (pg19): Using input(), the '/' and '%' operator, we will prompt the user to input any number of hours, which will return the amount of days/hours it's equivalent too.
  
  (pg20): This program is a kilometer to miles converter.

  (pg21): This program counts the amount of white pizels within an image, which resembles snow, and prints out the amount of white pixels within the image.

  (pg22): Simple logic gate equation with 3 inputs.

  (pg23): Demonstrating a simple NAND circuit.

  (pg24): This program prompts the user to enter a list of nouns, and then will print out the ratio of plural nouns to singular nouns

  (pg25): This program prompts the user to enter a list of commands for a turtle to follow. Their drawing is shown after. If they enter an unrecognized command, the program will print "ERROR".

  (pg26): Demonstrating a NOR circuit.

  (pg27): This program reads in a file and outputs a graph that shows the change in population overtime in a specific nyc borough, which is determined by the user.

  (pg28): This program reads in a file and outputs the maximum and mean of a borough, which is determined by the user.

  (pg29): Printing "Hello, World!" using unix commands.

  (pg30): Creating my github account and showing my username.

  (pg31): This program reads in a gile and makes a graph showing the relationship of DATE and the FRACTION OF CHILDREN in a shelter.

  (pg32): This program prints "Hello, World!" using functions.

  (pg33): This program prints a corner piece of an image.

  (pg34): This program prompts the user for a series of names, last name first followed by first name. Then, it'll organize the list by First/Last name order.

  (pg35): This program prints a greeting depending on the hour the user inputs (24hr time).

  (pg36): This program reads in a csv file which prints the top 10 worst vehicle related violations, depending on the column the user would like to filter through.

  (pg37): This program is a text file of an arithmetic circuit.
  
  (pg38): Using functions, this program prompts the user to enter an integer (1-12) and prints the numbers corresponding month name.

  (pg39): This program reads in a csv file and picks the top 3 reasons as to why there is are car accidents.

  (pg40): Using functions, this program prints a normal, and a nested triangle. The size of the triangle is up to the user.

  (pg41): Using functions, this program prints out the cost of LIRR fees depending if its peak/off-peak hours.

  (pg42): This program creates a map of NYC with a marker on Hunter College.

  (pg43): Using functions, this program converts a hexadecimal into a decimal.

  (pg44): Using functions, this program creates a map and marks the current location and closest point.

  (pg45): Using the random fucntion, this program has a turtle move in one direction then suddenly turn into a random direction. This pattern will keep going for 100 times, using for loops.

  (pg46): This program will prompt the user to enter a string. If its empty, it'll keep asking the user to enter one until its not empty (using while loops). Once a non-empty string is entered, it'll return the string the user has entered. 

  (pg47): Using unix commands, this program makes directories for a project.

  (pg48): Using MIPS, this program prints "Hello, World!".

  (pg49): Using MIPS, this programs counts by 5 starting from 0, all the way up to 50.

  (pg50): Using unix commands, this proogram counts the amount of '.py' files there are in a folder.

**Starting to learn C++**

  (pg51): This C++ program prints "Hello, World!" and "Hello, C++".

  (pg52): This C++ program prints a string 10 times.

  (pg53): This C++ program is a kilometer to miles converter. It prompts the user for a number in kilometers, then converts it to miles.

  (pg54): This C++ Program prints a greeting depending on what month (by number) the user enters.

  (pg55): This C++ program prints out a the birth year of the user, but it will keeps asking if its 2018 or more recent.

  (pg56): This C++ program prompts the user to enter a number between -31 and 31, then prints the 2's COMPLEMENTS of that number.
